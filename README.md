# My resume

Created this to try and expand my knowledge of CSS.

Design is inspired by Deedy LaTeX resume template found at: http://www.latextemplates.com/template/deedy-resume-cv

Hosted using GitHub pages at: http://alihussa.in/resume/

three main classes: .header, .body & .sidebar

.header contains .left and .right 
  * .left contains the name 
  * .right contains contact information

.body contains .section
  * .section contains .title & .sub-section
    * .title contains title of section
    * .sub-section contains .title & .text
      * .title contains title of sub-section (use class .no-title if sub-section has no title)
      * .text contains sub-section text

.sidebar is right 30% of page, same properties as .section in .body
